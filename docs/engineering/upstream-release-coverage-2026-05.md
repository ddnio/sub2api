# Upstream Release Coverage 2026-05

This document replaces ad-hoc continuation notes with a release-bounded coverage ledger. Releases are audit boundaries only; actual code movement remains upstream PR/merge-commit based.

## Baseline

- Local base: `origin/main` at `59b9cf34 docs(upstream-sync): close out deployed slices`.
- Upstream pinned scope: `upstream/main` at `48912014 chore: sync VERSION to 0.1.121 [skip ci]`.
- Latest upstream tag in scope: `v0.1.121`.
- Work branch: `feature/upstream-release-coverage-2026-05`.
- Worktree: `.claude/worktrees/upstream-release-coverage-2026-05`.
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-05-03-upstream-release-coverage.md`.

If `upstream/main` advances, do not expand this ledger automatically. Pin the new SHA and review the scope first.

## Rules

- Do not merge or cherry-pick an entire release.
- Code merge unit is upstream PR/merge commit or a smaller manually ported hunk.
- Already merged fork PRs #19-#35 are treated as current baseline and are not repeated.
- `HOLD` is the safe default for auth identity, pending OAuth, affiliate, channel monitor/insights, Vertex, Fast/Flex, OpenAI image refactors, payment semantics, schema/migration/Ent drift, license/CLA, and sponsor/readme churn.
- Docs-only PRs require `git diff --check`, self-review, Kimi review, and PR-level review; they do not deploy.
- Runtime PRs require targeted tests, self-review, Kimi pre-commit review, PR-level Kimi review, GitHub CI, and a recorded deployment gate if deployed.

## Ledger Semantics

This ledger PR is documentation-only in the fork. The upstream commits listed below are mostly code changes. Listing a code commit in this ledger does not authorize merging it; the `Action` column is the decision boundary.

- `MERGED`: the relevant behavior has already landed in this fork through a reviewed fork PR.
- `PRESENT`: current fork code already provides the behavior; no new PR is planned.
- `PARTIAL`: some behavior exists or was ported, but more upstream code is not automatically accepted.
- `PORT`: a future small PR may port a proven low-risk missing behavior.
- `HOLD`: do not implement without a separate product/architecture/migration plan.
- `SKIP`: intentionally ignore for this fork cycle, usually chore/version/churn or no proven local gap.

## Current CI Baseline

`origin/main` still has CI drift independent of release coverage. A separate local branch `fix/ci-baseline-green-2026-05` has commit `2e6b0cef fix(ci): restore baseline test and lint health`.

Local verification on that branch:

```bash
cd backend && make test-unit
# passed

cd backend && GOCACHE="$PWD/../../.cache/go-build" go test -tags=unit ./internal/server/middleware ./internal/service
# passed

pnpm --dir frontend install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir frontend typecheck
pnpm --dir frontend build
# passed; build emitted existing Vite chunk/dynamic import warnings only

git diff --check
# passed
```

Kimi review:

- First evidence pack timed out in wire transport after partial streaming.
- Smaller evidence pack returned `NO BLOCKERS`; runtime parser marked the prose result `INCONCLUSIVE`.

Push status:

- Push to `origin` is currently blocked by GitHub HTTPS errors: first `HTTP2 framing layer`, then `github.com:443` connection timeout.
- Open the CI baseline PR before merging further runtime release-alignment PRs.

## Release Coverage Matrix

### v0.1.117

Range: `v0.1.116..v0.1.117`.

| Upstream source | Area | Local state | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0a80ec80` | Version sync to v0.1.116 | Chore only | SKIP | Upstream version stamp, not behavior. |
| `ac114738` / PR #1850 | Channel insights | Held feature | HOLD | Ent/migration/backend/frontend feature family. |
| `ff08f9d7` / PR #1853 | Codex image generation bridge | Divergent image feature | HOLD | Image family conflicts with fork behavior and prior HOLD list. |
| `ca204ddd` | Preserve image outputs when text serialization fails | Image-adjacent fix | HOLD | Potentially useful, but tied to held image path; reopen only in image batch. |
| `a4e329c1` | Add default GPT-5.5 model | Model catalog/policy | HOLD | Not a safety fix; handle with a model catalog policy pass. |

Conclusion: covered except HOLD.

### v0.1.118

Range: `v0.1.117..v0.1.118`.

| Upstream source | Area | Local state | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `d162604f` | Version sync to v0.1.117 | Chore only | SKIP | Upstream version stamp. |
| `15ce914a` / PR #1910 | Codex tool call IDs | Prior sync family | PRESENT/PARTIAL | Covered by earlier Codex slices where applicable; no current missing behavior proven. |

| `7424c73b` | Remove unused model IDs | Prior HOLD | HOLD | Model catalog change; do not mix with safety sync. |
| `8f28a834` | Stripe top-level method display | Present | SKIP | Local visible methods include Stripe; payment flow tests cover top-level Stripe route. |
| `b95ffce2` / PR #1772 | OpenAI test state reconciliation | Prior sync family | PRESENT/PARTIAL | No missing local behavior currently proven. |
| `095f457c` / PR #1555 | `/responses/compact` account support | Prior sync family | PRESENT/PARTIAL | Covered enough by current OpenAI/Codex compatibility work unless new regression appears. |
| `641e6107` / PR #1940 | Codex CLI version bump | Dependency/tooling | HOLD | Dependency/policy update, not a low-risk runtime fix. |

| `9d801595` | Admin settings contract tests | Present/Docs closeout | SKIP | No runtime gap proven after PR #28/#29. |

Conclusion: covered except Anthropic global TTL HOLD.

## Remaining Decision List

- Decide whether to ever adopt upstream auth identity/pending OAuth migrations.
- Decide whether affiliate invite/rebate belongs in this fork.
- Decide whether channel monitor/insights belongs in this fork.
- Decide whether Vertex service account and Fast/Flex policy are product goals.
- Decide how to handle the OpenAI image family against existing fork behavior.
- Decide whether global Anthropic cache TTL is desired in addition to local account-level TTL override.
- Decide whether Codex API key rate-limit reset from PR #2027 is needed after a focused local audit.
- Decide whether ops retention zero from PR #2090 is desired after an ops-specific review.

## Current Next Action

1. Retry pushing `fix/ci-baseline-green-2026-05` and open the CI baseline PR.
2. Run Kimi review on this release coverage ledger.
3. Commit and open a docs-only release coverage PR.
4. Do not start runtime `PORT` work until the CI baseline PR is merged or GitHub CI is otherwise green.
